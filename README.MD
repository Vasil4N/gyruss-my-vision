# A Gyruss-Inspired Game in Unity


## Introduction
This project is my take on the popular arcade classic Gyruss - I wanted to have a public project in git and here is a simple game. In the game, players experience dynamic stages where the number of enemies increases with each level, and the gameplay becomes more challenging with different circular patterns. Currently you cannot lose the game, but if I get an interesting idea for killing the player I might implement it at some point in the future.
 
Time spent: ~8 hours

## How to play
The game is available to play for free on itch.io, where it runs directly in your browser. No download required!
